      <h3>I smiled at him. Hi master! Trying to cheer him up. Then master yelled and we off the bus. But I was enjoying the bus ride. So many happy faces. Like the drooling baby. Awe, so cute! He led me to a tall building and a bunch of people chased us! We ran. When we reached the top of the building, master ordered me. You fly him home! I gonna do that well!</h3>
