      <h3>I offered master food to cheer him up but he didn't want it. I thought it would make him happy. Then he dare not want it! Oh well... Then master yelled and we left the bus. He led me to a tall building and a bunch of people chased us! We ran. When we reached the top of the building, master ordered me. You fly him home.</h3>
