      <h3>"THIS EXAM WILL TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE, MATH AND THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF PROFESSOR MEMBRANE." "Why do you have to take an exam to get into
          the audience?" You start it anyway. You look it over before asking how you are supposed to know what your dad&#39s first thought was. Gaz tells you it was.
          "I will poop now." You ask how she knows that, she replies. "It&#39s all here in his autobiography." You ask how she got in, she said she got in through the staff
          entrance. Confused, you ask if such thing exists, she shrugs.</h3>
