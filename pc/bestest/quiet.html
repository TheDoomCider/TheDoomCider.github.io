      <h3>Zim seems unfazed. “Very well. I'm going to get lost, but noticed I'm getting lost with my best friend!” He drags you away to further discuss the
          terms of your friendship. Later you and Zim play tether ball. He uses you like a paddle. You win and celebrate by doing the best friend dance you've
          been practicing. In art class, you and Zim draw pictures of the two of you together. Later you walk the hall with Zim. You accidentally bump into
          him, he pushes you down.</h3>
