      <p>Gir laughs hysterically, much to your annoyance, and leaves to go play with the box. Using the hitch he shakes it wildly bake and forth.
          The insane sirs activate and start destroying their box. At first you don't notice but Gir does. Gir greets the robots. Annoyed you scream, 
          Gir who are you talking to?! Gir quickly replies, my scary new friends! No sooner does he finish when, a sir unit opens its head up, revealing
          a saw blade and begins to saw through Gir's head. Gir hugs it, I love you too! Having just witnessed this, you end up failing to pay attention 
          to the Voot's course and crash into a giant donut! Gir and the sirs scream, Donut!</p>
