      <h3>Red points out he wasn't invited, you remind him he is supposed to be banished. He obviously doesn't understand the concept. Zim reminds you of his work in Operation Impending Doom 1. You try to use Zim's size against him, in a failed attempt to make him leave. Red tries to buy him off with a sandwich, but Zim won't leave until he gets his chance to prove himself.</h3>
