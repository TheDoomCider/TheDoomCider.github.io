      <h3>You appear on a slowing, lowering platform, before the crowd gathered on Conventia. Red is gloating
          about his laser idea being a hit. You aren't buying it and cling to your smoke machine suggestion.
          You get a laser in the eye and collapse in agony! The platform reaches the ground and Red begins
          addressing the crowd. &#34;Welcome mighty Irken soldiers! You are the finest examples of military training the Irken
          army has to offer! Good for you.&#34; He introduces the invaders chosen to gather information for operation impending
          doom 2. You join him in briefing them on their mission. Just
          as things are wrapping up, you hear a familiar voice. You shutter when you realize, it belongs to
          none other than Zim! He apologizes for his tardiness.</h3>
