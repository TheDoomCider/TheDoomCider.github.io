      <h3>You pull a flashlight out of your pocket and position it behind your back. You flash it in time with your movements. Iggins is startled. While he recovers, you sneak over to the mirror and write "the game is mine". By the time he sees your message, you're back at the window. You flash the light twice more, making him even more uncomfortable.</h3>
