      <h3>Gir looks around at the dark forest before asking. "How us getting home?" An overconfident grin appears on
          your face. "I&#39m glad you asked! Remember when we got lost in the city?" Gir frowns. "No." You ignore him.
          "Well I decided to create a navigator. That way, we will never get lost on this pathetic 
          planet again!" You reach into your pak and pull out what looks like a GPS. "I called it a MAP: Mechanical
          Area Pinpointer. Using the MAP, I can figure out how to get back to the base!" While you configure the map,
          Gir gets restless. In the distance he sees an owl. Thinking it is the monkey from tv, he rushes over to it.
          You finish with the MAP. "Ok, Gir lets..." You notice Gir is missing!
