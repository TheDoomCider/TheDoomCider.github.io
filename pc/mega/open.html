      <h3>Flash back to earlier that day. Gir is watching his favorite monkey on TV. You come up from the toilet and pause to think.
          "My pak is charged, i'm disguised and Gir is under control. Why can't I shake this that I have forgotten something? Oh well,
          it&#39s probably not important." Back to the present. You sigh, of all the days to forget to bathe in paste.</h3>
