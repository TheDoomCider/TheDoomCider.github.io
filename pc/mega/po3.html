      <h3>Without warning the Megadoomer shuts off. Despite the shocking turn of events, you play it up. "I destroyed your army! Surrender to your new ruler!"
          Nothing seems to be happening. "Ok well I'll float here um... menacingly for as long as it takes!" A few hours of boredom later, you hear someone
          approach you. It is president man informing you of Earth's surrender. You maniacally laugh while thinking. "I can't believe that worked!" Next thing
          you know, you're standing on a podium about to give your elaborate acceptance speech! When you are finally crowned dictator of Earth, you rush off to
          tell the Tallest!</h3>
