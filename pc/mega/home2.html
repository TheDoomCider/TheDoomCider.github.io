      <h3>You shrug it off and head home to get your carrier. Your computer disguises it as a bee. Now in your human disguise, wearing a foil hat and armed with
          a giant bee, you head back. When you arrive at your ship, you notice of Gir. He's running around in circles, while being chased by a crowd! "Catch me!
          Catch me!" Impressed with your sidekick's reckless behaviour, you hone in on your ship. After encasing it in the bee, you climb on board and try to get
          Gir's attention. "Hey Gir! The scary monkey show is starting soon!" Panic washes over Gir's face. He runs over to you and climbs on board. "Onward to
          the monkey!" You fly away while the crowd's heads are still spinning.</h3>
