      <h3>You pull out a picture of Dib, which looks like it's been used for target practice and hand it to one of sirs. &#34;Now destroy the Dib worm!&#34; They run 
          off to complete their mission. You follow them to Dib's house, not wanting to miss his final moments. Dib hears you laughing and heads outside to see
          what you're up to. The second he opens the door, the sirs tackle him to the ground and demolish his house! Gaz is in the middle of her game when the
          place turns to rubble. She's beyond angry and ends up scaring the robots away. As they fly off into space, you're left standing there. You turn to
          run, but Gaz beats you to a pulp. Dib is overjoyed and rushes off to call the swollen eye. Gaz is annoyed by his happiness. She beats him up too,
          before heading back into what is left of her room. You call Gir to come get you, he obeys and takes you back to the base.</h3>
