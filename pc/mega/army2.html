      <h3>The army shows up to deal with you, accompanied by Dib! He yells at you. "You're not going to get away with this one Zim!" You think to yourself.
          "Now you're making this interesting Dib pig." The army fires the first shot, just missing you. You laugh at their pathetic attempt to hit you and
          hurtle several missiles their way. Dib mocks you. "With all that destruction, I would have thought you'd be able to aim by now!" He's really
          getting on your nerves now! "Maybe I should use your head as a target, it's size would make it easy to hit!" You hit them with everything you've 
          got.</h3>
