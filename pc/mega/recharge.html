      <h3>Luckily the power source is rechargeable and you happen to have a make shift charger for it. Once everything is set up, you
          impatiently ask your computer how long the charging process will take to complete. It replies. "Three point eight
          Earth hours." You yell at it. "That&#39s too long! Can&#39t you make it charge faster?" The computer warns. "I can fully charge it
          in two Earth minutes BUT." You interrupt. "Yeah, yeah whatever. I just do it!" The computer sighs. "FINE, but when the battery
          explodes, don't come yelling to me!" Two minutes later it alerts you that the battery is charged. You put it back 
          into the Megadoomer. Climbing into the robot, you power it on once again. The engine starts up and you bash the robot into the 
          front of your base, creating a giant hole for it to escape through. Do you activate the cloaking device?</h3>
