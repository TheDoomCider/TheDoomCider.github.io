      <h3>You head back and instruct him to guard the ship while you get the carrier. His eyes flash red as he salutes. You rush home and command your computer
          to bring you the Voot carrier. "Processing, Processing!" He disguises it as a giant bee. You set out in your human disguise with a foil hat and the giant bee. When you arrive
          at the park Gir and the ship are each on separate pedestals. The place is crawling with humans. Marching up to the displays, you are stopped by a
          familiar female pig smelly. You quickly pull a cupcake out of your pak and wave it in front of Gir. He squeals. "Cupcake!" You throw it, he takes off
          after it. The guard lady forgets about you and takes off after Gir. You take the opportunity to encase your ship in the bee. You climb on and take out 
          another cupcake. "Hey Gir, I have some more cupcakes for you!" Gir excitedly flies over to you. By the time the humans have figured out they've been
          duped, you're long gone.</h3>
