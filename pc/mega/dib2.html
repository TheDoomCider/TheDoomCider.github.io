      <h3>You head towards the Dib's house, destroying everything in your path! It's not long before you arrive at Dib's house.
          Hearing you outside, he comes out to investigate. "I've put up with you long enough Dib!" You fire the doom canon at Dib,
          he didn't stand a chance. You head off to the city to celebrate. Your joyride is cut short by the army. Since you're not cloaked
          they dish a great deal of damage your way. You cover fire with some missiles.</h3>
