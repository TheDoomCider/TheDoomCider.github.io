      <h3>"Hahaha! That's right Dib! I am in your head and with the touch of a button, I will unleash stupidity across your brain." *Nooo!* "Unless you destroy those pictures!" *Wait, do I have time to think it over?* "Uh.... no!" *Well at least class over. Now I'm going to start walking home.* "Do you have to narrate everything you're doing?" *No, I'm doing it to bug you.* You put Dib on mute, and hack into his surveillance system. When the cameras catch sight of Dib, you unmute him. *I wonder... I wonder what shaking my head would do to Zim. Maybe I should-* "Don't you dare!" *Oh, you're back. I knew you were listening the whole time, I was just kidding.* "Quit dallying and destroy the pictures!" You watch Dib head to his room and take out a disk. He breaks it in half. *There! Now leave my brain alone.* "Haha! In your face Dib!"</h3>
