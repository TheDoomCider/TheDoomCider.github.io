      <h3>You plot to steal Zim's mission, to prove yourself to the Tallest. And as a bonus, make his skool life miserable before revealing your intentions. As your studies turn to humanity, you learn about corporations. The topic fascinates you, becoming a major aspect of your grand plan to:
        <ol>
          <li>Assume the life of a CEO's daughter</li>
          <li>Gather the resources necessary to build a magma pump, under the disguise of a corporate venture</li>
          <li>Ruin Zim's life</li>
          <li>Use the pump to empty Earth's core and fill it with snacks, as an offering to the Tallest</li>
        </ol>
     Steps 1 and 2 go off without a hitch, bringing you to step 3 of your plan. How do you plan to ruin Zim's life?
