      <h3>They obey, and start running rampantly through the streets on your behalf. Gir runs after them. &#34;Wait! We not done!&#34; You turn on the TV and watch the
          chaos unfold. It isn't long until the world is brought to it's knees! You're later on a podium, giving the five-hour acceptance speech, you've been
          preparing for so long. Meanwhile president man and the other world leaders come together to give you dominion over Earth! Shortly after the ceremony
          concludes, you call the Tallest to inform them of your victory. Red is the first to speak. &#34;You did what??&#34; You beam. &#34;I conquered Earth my Tallest!&#34;
          Red conferences with Purple. &#34;What are we going do now that Zim has conquered Earth?&#34; Purple shrugs. &#34;We could turn the planet into a giant snack after
          we think up a way to get rid of him. In the meantime, we should let him rule Earth.&#34; Red likes this idea. &#34;Yeah, he can bug someone else for awhile.&#34;
          Red concludes the conference. &#34;Good job in completing your mission! We have decided to let you stay and keep Earth in check.&#34; You salute. &#34;Thank you,
          sirs, Invader Zim signing off.&#34;</h3>
