      <h3>The sirs are trying to get in through the holes they've bored. Using your pak legs you attempt to fend them off in a Whack-a-Dib sort of fashion. "Ahh 
          Whack-a-Dib, why did Gir have to destroy you?" "Whack-a-Dib?" "Go away Dib stink! You're not even in this scene!"... Anyway, you are quickly overrun. As the
          sirs flood in, you get pushed up against the windshield.</h3>
