      <h3>He yells at you. "You're not going to get away with this one Zim!" You think to yourself. "Now you're making this interesting Dib pig."
          The army fires the first shot, just missing you. You laugh at their pathetic attempt to hit you. You stop when you remember you're still cloaked and hurtle several missiles their way. Dib mocks you. "With all that destruction, I would have thought you'd be able to aim by now!" He is really 
          getting on your nerves! "Maybe I should use your head as a target, it's size would make it easy to hit!" You hit them with everything you've got.
