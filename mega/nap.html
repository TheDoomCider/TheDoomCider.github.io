    <h3>Gir yawns and keeps trying to sleep on your head! Every time he is about to get cozy, you push him off. He has been doing this nonstop for
        five minutes now and it is really getting on your nerves! Eventually he gets bored of this and heads out to play with the box. Using the hitch he shakes it wildly bake and forth. The insane sirs activate and start 
        destroying their box. At first you don't notice but Gir does. Gir greets the robots. Annoyed you scream. "Gir who are you talking to?!" Gir quickly 
        replies. "My scary new friends!" No sooner does he finish when, a sir unit opens its head up, revealing a saw blade and begins to saw through Gir's head.
        Gir hugs it. "I love you too!" Having just witnessed this, you end up failing to pay attention to the Voot's course and crash into a giant donut! Gir 
        and the sirs scream. "Donut!"</h3>
