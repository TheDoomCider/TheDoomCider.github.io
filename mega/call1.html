      <h3>You call Gir. He answers from a display pedestal. You instruct him to stay and guard the ship. You show up later disguised with a giant bee. Gir sees
          you. "Hi master!" You try to ignore him but he has already succeeded in alerting the crowd to your presence. You quickly take out an alien balloon
          throw it into the wind. "Look, its the alien!" While they are distracted you put your ship in the bee. The crowd seems to have caught onto your
          trick, so you quickly grab Gir and make your getaway.</h3>
