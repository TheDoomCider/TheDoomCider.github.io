      <h3>You are thinking biking by his house will surely get his attention! You steal a bike from one of Zim's neighbours and chant demonically. A duplicate of
          yourself appears next to you, bike and all. You bike back to Zim's house, slowly passing it so your twin his enough time to get into position. The
          second you've passed your friend's house, he copies your actions. Zim closes the blinds. You snap your fingers, causing your doppelganger to
          disappear. You're running out of ideas, so you take a break. As you fixate on your bestie's house, you realize there
          is one thing that you haven't tried. You walk back up to Zim's porch and ring his doorbell. The door opens revealing the green dog. "You no leprechaun."
          You interrupt him. "Who are you and where is Zim?" He points at a toilet. "I'm Gir! My master is busy in the toilet!" You are somewhat disappointed. "Oh... when will he be back?" Gir shrugs. "I don't know. Wanna do stuff?"</h3>
