      <h3>"Wanna go to the circus?" Gir excitedly agrees. He takes in all of the sights along the way, which makes for a long trip. You're so happy that he is having fun, you don't
          mind. When you finally arrive, you buy two tickets and sit up front with Gir. He becomes obsessed with the bear on a tricycle. At the end of the show he tries to get his autograph.
          You stop him just in time and explain that, bears don't give autographs. Gir is saddened by this. After you leave the tent, you realize how late
          it is. "We should get back to Zim, he is probably worried sick!" You rush home. "Zim were home!" There is no answer. "He must be still in the toilet and it is a little early for
          breakfast. I know, we can form a band!" Gir is baffled. "Ohh. What's that?" You raid Zim's kitchen for cookware and quickly assemble to two drum sets. You hand Gir two spoons, 
          keeping two for yourself. You begin banging on a metal bowl and Gir joins in on the pot you gave him. Two minutes later, an angry Zim emerges from the toilet. "What's going on?!"
          His eyes narrow when he sees you. He kicks you out of the house and tells you to go home. You reluctantly obey, since you are kind of tired. The next day you arrive 
          early to make Zim breakfast. You open the door and see Zim on the couch. He gestures for you to come over. "Ah, Keef. I have something important to tell you." He puts his mouth next to
          your ear. "I DON'T WANT TO BE YOUR FRIEND ANYMORE!" Your ears are ringing so loud, you can barely hear your heart breaking! You run home, crushed.</h3>
