      <h3>Gir thinks about this. "Wanna watch the monkey?" You follow him to the couch and stare at the screen. "What season is this?" Gir shrugs, you continue. 
          "I'm currently on season 4 and my favorite episode is the one where monkey doesn't blink for five minutes." Gir smiles. "I
          like it when he stares." You spend the entire night watching Angry Monkey. At some point you end up outside on the ground. All that you remember is you have skool and break into a sprint, to avoid being late. At lunch you sit with your friends and out of the corner of your eye you see a
          green kid. He looks farmilliar, like an old friend but you can't so much as remember his name.</h3>
