      <h3>He has been out your company for two seconds now! You can't stand being apart from him any longer. You call him. "Hi, Zim!" He seems surprised by your
          call. He seems like he is about to hang up so you call him on your other phone. He tells you he has another call and he answers it. When he finds out
          it is you, he hangs up.</h3>
