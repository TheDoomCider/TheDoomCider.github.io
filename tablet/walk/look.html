      <h3>Anyway, I ran over and grabbed the chippie thingie from master. He yelled and chased me. I kept running, staring at it and hit the wall. Master took it from me and went back to working. Then he installed it in my head and let my bees go! My bees... Why my bees? Then I blacked out and master wanted to go on an adventure. Blah! I don't wanna go on adventure, I want my bees back.</h3>
