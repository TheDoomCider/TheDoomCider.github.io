      <h3>"THIS EXAM WILL TEST YOUR KNOWLEDGE OF SCIENCE, MATH AND THE PERSONAL HISTORY OF PROFESSOR MEMBRANE" You ask how you are supposed to
          know what your dad&#39s first thought was. Gaz tells you it was. "I will poop now." You ask how she knows that. She replies. "It&#39s all here
          in his autobiography." You ask how she got in, she said she got in through the staff entrance. Confused, you ask if such thing exists, she
          shrugs.</h3>
