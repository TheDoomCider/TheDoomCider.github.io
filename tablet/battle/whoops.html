      <h3>Shunk is angered, Gaz taunts Shunk trying to get you killed. You don&#39t get to see anything before the announcer declares, battle 2 of 3,
          a test on pyrochaos. The floor lowers, revealing multiple, spaced Pedestals. Flames shoot out of the newly formed void. Not long after,
          Shunk attacks over you repeatedly until you end up clinging to the top of the arena. Shunk demands that you come down and face him. You
          refuse. He shakes the cage until you fall. Shunk wins the round, causing the floor to return to normal. When you finally catch your breath,
          you ask Gaz to tell Shunk that you&#39ve reconsidered the tie offer. Gaz tells Shunk lies, which make Shunk want to eat you. The announcer declares
          the final round on cyborarachnarama. The two robot spiders come out, you climb in one.</h3>
