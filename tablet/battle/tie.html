      <h3>You hit each other's buzzers at the same time, resulting in a tie. At first it doesn't seem to work, so you repeat the
          process, until you both end up in the audience! Now all you have to do is make it to your dad. You wait until he is on stage, then make your
          way to the front of the crowd. You try to get his attention. "Dad! Over here! I need you to sign this!" You pass him the slip, and he signs it!
          You make your way to the swollen eyeball meeting. Do you have your briefcase?</h3>
