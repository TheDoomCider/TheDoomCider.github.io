      <h3>You ask Shunk about the tie offer, he mocks you. It's not long before he has destroyed his and your cyber spider. You're laying in defeat
          as Shunk taps you on the hit marker. Shunk is the winner. The announcer asks all the losers to leave the area. Two guards barge in accompanied
          by the same guard from earlier, to escort you out. You beg for a dna scan, they ignore you. You notice a clock displaying 8PM, this causes
          you to scream. As the guards continue to drag you toward the exit, you see Gaz. Desperately, you ask for her help as she waves goodbye. You
          open the briefcase and ask the guard if he has a pen.</h3>
