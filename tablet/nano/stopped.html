      <h3>Dib dodges the two electric claws coming out of the ceiling. As he pauses to gloat. A claw zaps him from behind, this causes him to drop his camera. You quickly dive for it but Dib tackles you. You push him off. The camera rolls over towards Gir. Dib looks over and sees Gir bouncing the camera on his head. He desperately jumps trying to catch it. Using your pak legs, you snatch it out of the air. You tease Dib, dangling it just out of his reach. He kicks you in the shin causing you to smash the camera.</h3>
