      <h3>You pretend pull something out from behind you and introduce it to Zim. &#34;This is our topic secret model, Lir.&#34; Zim gives you a hard look. 
          &#34;I don't see anything...&#34; Purple chimes in. &#34;Yes well, that's what the enemy will think. Get it?&#34; Zim is fascinated. &#34;How does it work?&#34; You 
          answer. &#34;Very well thanks for asking.&#34; "Eh?" You inform Zim that there are other invaders behind you. He moves, 
          calling Lir before heading off. Six months later you receive a call from Earth. Zim appears on a screen catching you off guard. He complains. &#34;Lir 
          isn't very obedient! In fact, he's down right lazy. You snicker at the fact, Zim still hasn't figured out Lir isn't real. Purple pretends to 
          troubleshoot. &#34;Maybe youâ€™re not ordering him order right. Have you tried singing to him?&#34; You and Purple break down laughing. Zim isn't 
          following. &#34;Singing? What do you mean my tallest?&#34; You try to keep a straight face. &#34;He responds best when you sing him his commands.
          &#34; Zim starts to get it. &#34;Ok? Thank you my tallest, Invader Zim signing off.&#34; He hangs up.</h3>
