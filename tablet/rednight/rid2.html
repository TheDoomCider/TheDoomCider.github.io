      <h3>You explain to Zim that there are no more invader spots left. Purple pipes up. &#34;Yeah, Skooge got the last one!&#34; Zim is angered by this. 
          &#34;SKOOGE!&#34; The Irkens around Skooge spread out, revealing his location. Skooge flees in terror, closely followed by Zim. Just as you and
          Purple turn to leave, you are confronted by Zim and a tied up Skooge. &#34;Skooge said he would give me his mission.&#34; He kicks Skooge. 
          &#34;Didn't you.&#34; Skooge nods in agreement. You think about this for a moment. &#34;Congratulations Zim, you have been assigned to the planet
          Blorch.&#34; He salutes. &#34;I will do you proud.&#34; The invaders report to the equipment hall to be assigned sirs. Zim is next in line to get 
          his.</h3>
