      <h3>Just when you think things cannot get any worse, you notice the sirs are trailing you. So now you're about to go over a waterfall, without
          protection, while under heavy fire. Why not? With Gir's help, you ditch the ship and make it to land. The waterfall takes care of the robot menaces.
          Now you are lost.
