      <h3>You are inches away from the waterfall when you are swallowed! Now you, Gir and the Voot are stuck in the belly of a giant lake monster! While you
          try to figure out what to do, Gir gets insane. He flies at the wall and bounces around inside the creature. This causes it to hurl. Disgusting and
          disoriented, you find yourself on shore. You wipe the goo off. Gir shakes off on you. You clean yourself up again. Looking around, you come to the
          realization that you are lost.</h3>
