      <h3>The army shows up to deal with you, accompanied by Dib! He yells at you. &#34;You're not going to get away with this one Zim!&#34; You think to yourself. 
          &#34;Now you're making this interesting Dib pig.&#34; The army fires the first shot, just missing you. You laugh at their pathetic attempt to hit you. 
          You stop when you remember your still cloaked and hurtle several missiles their way. Dib mocks you. &#34;With all that destruction, I would have
          thought you'd be able to aim by now!&#34; He's really getting on your nerves now! &#34;Maybe I should use your head as a target, it's size would make
          it easy to hit!&#34; You hit them with everything you've got.</h3>
