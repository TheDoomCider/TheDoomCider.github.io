      <h3>You stop in front of Bloaty's pizza hog. "Why did you bring me to this, horror-filled place, Gir? I told you to guide us home!" Before Gir can answer,
          you see Dib and his scary sister. They are leaving the restaurant. Dib notices you. "What are you up to Space boy?" He is about the pull out his camera
          when Gaz grabs him. "Come on Dib, you can play with Zim on your own time!" Dib starts to protest but the fire in Gaz silences him. As they walk away,
          you guide Gir home.</h3>
