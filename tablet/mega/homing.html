      <h3>Thankfully you installed a Gir homing feature. He isn't too far way. You find him with an owl. You demand he put it down and fly you back to the base.
          Gir obeys and before you know it, you're on your way home. Now you have a bone to pick with the Tallest. You call and ask them about the sir units. At first they play dumb, but Purple eventually
          explains. "Oh, those sirs. Since you have been doing a good job on Earth, we decided to send an army to help you out." Red interrupts. "They must 
          have gotten damaged during transport." Satisfied with their explanation you hang up.</h3>
