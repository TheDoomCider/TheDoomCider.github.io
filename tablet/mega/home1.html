      <h3>You walk in the direction of your base thinking. "It's just Gir. I'm sure he'll be fine." One week later. You are coming up from your lab. "Gir,
          what have you done with... Oh yeah. I wonder how he's doing." You sigh and call him but there is no answer. "It's probably just as well, he wasn't a
          very good henchman anyway. Although, I do miss blaming him for stuff." There's a knocking at the door. When you answer it, you notice it is Gir. He
          is in duty mode and doesn't appear to be happy! "Hi, master. Remember me? I guess not, since you left me behind." He is starting to creep you out.
          "Oh, about that-" He doesn't wait for you to finish. "While I was gone, I was fixed. Now I'm in control, no longer held hostage by the Gir you once 
          knew! With that out of the way, let's get down to business. I've come to-" You interrupt. "To further assist me in completing my mission!" Gir shakes
          his head. "No. I've come to end you!"</h3>
