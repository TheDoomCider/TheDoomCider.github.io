      <h3>"Gir? Gir?! GGGIIIIRRR!!!" Gir stops playing with the owl. He says goodbye to the terrified bird and flies
          back to you. You hear what you think is a death bee coming right for you! In a flash response, you hit Gir over 
          the head with your MAP, shattering it. Realizing what you just did, you take it out on Gir. "Gir! Look what you made
          me do! Now how are we going to get home?!" Gir just stares at you blankly.</h3>
