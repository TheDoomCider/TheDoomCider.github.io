      <h3>Gir stops fighting and pounders for a moment before addressing his new pals. "Why we fighting?" The sirs shrug. Gir looks down and
          sees a bakery. "We should go get cupcakes!" Gir and the sirs exit the ship and fly to the bakery, leaving you dazed. When you snap out 
          of it, you notice that the Voot is hovering over a flaming bakery. Not even bothering to question it, you take stock of the Voot&#39s 
          current functionality. To your surprise it is flyable! Using the ship&#39s communication system, you call Gir. Does he answer?</h3>
