      <h3>The insane sirs activate mid-flight and start destroying their box. At first you don't notice but Gir does. He leaves the ship and 
          greets the robots. Annoyed you scream. "Gir, who are you talking to?!" Gir quickly replies. "My scary new friends!" No sooner does he 
          finish when, a sir unit opens its head up, revealing a saw blade, it begins to saw through Gir's head. Gir hugs it. "I love you too!" 
          Having just witnessed this, you end up failing to pay attention to the Voot's course and crash into a giant donut! Gir and the sirs
          scream. "Donut!"</h3>
