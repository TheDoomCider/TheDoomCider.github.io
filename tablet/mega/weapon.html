      <h3>You shortly return with a scary-looking ray gun but the sirs are nowhere to be found. You go to ask Gir where they went but he's missing too! Then you
          notice the TV is still on, displaying a newscaster. &#34;Robots are destroying the city! No one is safe!&#34; You drop your weapon and sit back, taking in the
          mayhem. It's not long before they bring the city and soon the world to it's knees! The military and the Dib were no match for their insanity and thirst
          for destruction! You are in disbelief when president man and the other world leaders come together to give Gir rule over the Earth! Disbelief quickly
          turns to outrage! &#34;Hey, Gir's taking credit for my win! Zim rules this world not his horrible sir unit!&#34; You fly to the ceremony in your Voot. Now 
          face to face with your former ally, ready to battle for dominion over Earth. You demand that Gir give up his power to you, he refuses. Your efforts
          to make him reconsider, land you in jail. You sigh, accepting your fate until you realize your cellmate is none other than Dib!</h3>
