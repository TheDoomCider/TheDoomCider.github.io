      <h3>You head towards the Dib's house, destroying everything in your path! It's not long before you arrive at Dib's house.
          Hearing you outside, he comes out to investigate. "I've put up with you long enough Dib, now fight an enemy you cannot see!"
          Dib tells you he can still see the cord. You brush off his comment and fire the doom canon at him. The power draw shorts out 
          the city's electrical grid, leaving you powerless. You panic as Dib and Gir take countless pictures of the Megadoomer. Out of
          options, you hit the self destruct and eject. After the robot explodes, you steal Dib's camera. He fights you for it and 
          eventually steals it back.</h3>
