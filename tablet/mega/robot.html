      <h3>Dib shows up in a giant robot similar in size to the Megadoomer! It is blue and has a Dib likeness to it. He rambles on about stopping you
          but you don't care enough to bother listening to him. You fire a laser hoping that will shut him up, he moves causing you to miss. Before you can unleash another
          attack, Dib kicks you with his robotic foot, almost knocking you over! The blow destroys the cloaking device, making you visible. "Now you&#39re
          just asking for it Dib!" You hit him with everything! Unfortunately, his shield absorbed the impact. Dib laughs and uses his robot to pick you up.
          The Megadoomer kicks the Dib bot in the face. Catching one of your robot legs, he rips it off, throwing you back to your base to wallow in defeat.</h3>
