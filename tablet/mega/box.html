      <h3>You return with forcefield box. You notice that the sirs are wrecking the joint and have even enlisted Gir! In a flash of brilliance, you spot one of 
          Gir's stray tacos. Picking it up you draw their attention to it. They're just as taco crazed as Gir. You drop it in the box, they fly in after it. 
          You are about to celebrate your genius when you notice Gir wants the taco too. Quickly, you grab him and seal up the box, before the robots can escape.
          &#34;Now to ship these horrible things back to their sender.&#34; You pause when you notice that the Tallest sent them to you. You run off to contact them
          leaving Gir to play with the box. Once you get things cleared up, you return to a base full of insane sirs. You scream. &#34;GGIRR!&#34;</h3>
