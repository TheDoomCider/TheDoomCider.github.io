      <h3>The officers scream as the Voot quickly closes in on their position. The pilot frantically tries to avoid it, while the co 
          repeatedly yells, directly in his ear. "Get out of way, we're gonna crash!" The pilot snaps. "What do you think I&#39m doing?!" They 
          collide. The cruiser makes it out with only a dented windshield, the helicopter isn&#39t so lucky. As they plummet to their 
          doom, the pilot turns to his co pilot and states. "I blame you." Meanwhile in the Voot Runner... You let out a sigh of relief, 
          "That pitiful Earth vehicle didn&#39t stand a chance!" Annoyed, you push Gir aside and re-establish control of the ship.</h3>
