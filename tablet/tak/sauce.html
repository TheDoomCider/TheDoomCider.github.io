      <h3>You pull out some barbecue sauce and squirt him in the face. You laugh at how ridiculous he looks, he laughs too. When he's not looking, you put a trash can over his head and kick him. He doesn't seem to get the hint, proceeding to bug you numerous times throughout the day. Each time, you come up with a clever way to make him pay. The next day, you finally break his spirit. After skool you confront him at his base. He thinks your there regarding that non-existent relationship. You reveal your true self and tell him your backstory, which he of course interrupts.</h3>
