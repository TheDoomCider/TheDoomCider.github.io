      <h3>You grab Gir and start running. "Gir, get me out of here now!" Gir activates his boosters and flies you home. Now your ship is in enemy hands! You 
          quickly set out in your Skool child disguise, accompanied by your Voot carrier, disguised as a giant bee! Before you reach the morons, you tie 
          your bee to a nearby tree. You take a foil hat and an alien balloon out of your pak. Putting on the hat, you sneak up to the gathering. You let 
          go of the balloon and draw the crowd's attention to it. "Hey, look an alien!" The wind catches it, while they're distracted you retrieve your bee. 
          Using it to encapsulate the Cruiser, you get away just as the crowd catches on to your deceit.</h3>
