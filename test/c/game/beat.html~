        <h3>You stomp down to the parking garage and locate Dib. He thanks you for finding him, oblivious to the roaring fire in your eyes. Your rage fueled silence and slow approach make him very uneasy. He slowly backs away until he's cornered. When you finally reach him, you angerly beat him to pulp!</h3>
