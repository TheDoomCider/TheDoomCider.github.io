      <h3>You tell Zim you have a top-secret model for him and quickly build one out of garbage. Purple throws it on the floor in front of Zim, who doesn't
          think it looks good. Purple counters. &#34;Yes, well that what the enemy will think! Get it?&#34; Zim thinks is genius. You snicker as Gir activates. &#34;Gir,
          reporting for duty.&#34; Zim is curious about what the G stands for. Gir doesn't know, he bangs his head and carrying on. Zim is concerned
          about it's intelligence. Purple reassures him. You inform Zim that there are other invaders behind him. He moves, fetching Gir before heading off.
          You are happy to say that, that is the last time you've ever seen or heard from him.</h3>
