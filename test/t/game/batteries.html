        <h3>You remember that Game Slaves drain batteries rather quickly. So, you gather up all the batteries in the house and wait in the bathroom. Sure enough, Iggins needs new batteries. After franticly running around, he locates you. You hold a large bag of batteries over the toilet, threatening to drop them. Iggins insults you causing you to let go of the bag. He freaks out and leaves the house, but you know exactly where he's going. You race to the battery store and enter the elevator. Before you exit to the roof, you sabotage the control panel. You climb down the building and hide. When you hear the elevator reach the roof, you climb up and join Iggins inside.</h3>
