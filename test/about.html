    <h3>Where did the idea come from?</h3>
   
    <p>Just after I got into Invader Zim I started discovering some of the different fan projects linked to it. I thought it was amazing that fans were make these contributions to the show. I wanted to contribute to the fandom as well with my own project but didn’t have any ideas.</p>
    
    <p>I had just started taking Python as part of my college course. The instructor was lecturing about if statements. He compared them to a choose your own adventure story. That didn’t give me the idea right off the bat. Eventually I started on Python based proto-type called invader_zim _sim. It featured a mock character list, and an incomplete version of Megadoomer. Unfortunately, it took forever to program and compatibility was a major issue.</p>
    
    <p>Rather than giving up I created a trailer for it and came up with a name. I called it The DoomCider, a play on doom and decider. When I published the trailer, I was surprised that people were excited to play it. So, I worked on a compatibility solution. Fortunately, I was also taking web design.</p>
    
    <p>The transition from if statements to separate web pages, dramatically simplified and sped up development. Despite the speed boost Megadoomer was still taking forever to complete and I began growing impatient with my miniscule progress. After about a month of development, I finally got to an ending. In ended creating two others and turn the incomplete page maze into a demo.</p>
    
    <p id="bottom">Before it released, I recalled a video I had watched one month prior to creation of The DoomCider. It was published by Shining Cecil and involved him read the Pokemon hand book in Zim’s voice. It stuck in my memory and sparked the idea of character narrators.</p>
