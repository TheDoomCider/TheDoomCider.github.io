      <h3>Not wanting to deal with Zim, you call for the guards to arrest him! Zim is scared and confused. &#34;What are you doing my tallest?&#34; His question annoys
          you. &#34;Taking you back to Foodcourtia.&#34; Zim counters. &#34;I quit remember?&#34; Sizzlorr barges into the convention hall. &#34;Well I beg to differ!&#34; Zim gulps
          before being returned to Foodcourtia. A week later, on the massive, you receive an incoming call. Zim appears on the screen. &#34;I passed your test my
          tallest!&#34; You and Purple are confused. &#34;What test?&#34; Zim answers. &#34;Don't be so modest. You shipped me back to Foodcourtia with heightened security.
          To see if I would be prepared to escape an enemy prison, in event I got captured during my mission. So what is it?&#34; You are still not following.
          &#34;What is what?&#34; Zim laughs. "My mission, silly." Purple takes over. &#34;Oh right, that. Since you did such a great job on Foodcourtia, you get to...&#34;
          You help him out. &#34;Test the empire's prisons. Since you&#39;re such a great escape artist. Purple likes where you are going with this. yeah, we will send
          some guards to take you to Vort and get you started.&#34;</h3>
