        <h3>He won't stop talking and it's really getting on your nerves! You glare at him. "I don't care! Now stop talking or I will-" He ignores you. You sigh and put up with him. Finally, you're at the front of the line. The clerk informs you that there are no more Game Slaves. You insist that there must be one left and he remembers that there was a pre-order for someone by the name of Clarence Wong. And if he doesn't show up to claim it, it's yours. Iggins, the annoying kid, claims to be him, walking off with YOUR Game Slave! You confront him. "You're no Clarence Wong! You stole my Game Slave! I'll buy it from you, but there's no way you're keeping it. Not without invoking my wrath anyhow!" He brushes you off and joins his mother in the car.</h3>
