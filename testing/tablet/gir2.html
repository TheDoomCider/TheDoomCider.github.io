      <h3>Using the sub's computer you access Dib's memory lobe. A series of icons appear on your screen representing memories. You select one displaying an undisguised version of you. A video of your base appears onscreen narrated by Dib.<br/><br/>"I rushed back home in disbelief. Finally, I had proof that Zim is an alien! I eagerly downloaded the pictures to my computer. Not taking any chances, I copied the files onto two floppy disks and stashed them under my pillow. That way if Zim tries to steal them, I would know."<br/><br/>You call Gir. "Gir, I have a very important mission for you." He's excited. "I need you to go to Dib's house and-" Gir interrupts. "Where he live?" "I'll send you the coordinates in a minute. Once there I need you to-" "But I want them now!" You sigh and send them to him. "Woo! Now what you want master?" "When you get to Dib's house, call me back." Its been over an hour now and Gir still hasn't called you. You call to check in on him. He appears to be at some sort of party. "Hi master!" "Gir? What are you doing? I told you to go to Dib's." Gir seems to remember. "Oh yeah... I was on my way there when a squirrel showed up and-" You've had it with Gir. "I don't care! Go to Dib's house! Now!" "Fine, lemme just say goodbye to my friends" "No Gir, go NOW!" Gir reluctantly heads over to Dib's. Once there, you guide him to his room. "Ok, now that you're in, just..." The door opens and Dib walks in, Gir greets him. "Hi!" Dib is startled by his presence. "Ahh! Um... hi? Get out of my room?" "Okey dookey." Gir jumps out the window.</h3>
