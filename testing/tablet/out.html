      <h3>You are relieved when you realize Gir is still out getting his suck monkey. You hide behind the chair and wait. A few minutes later Gir skips in
          leaving the door open. A minute later your past self arrives on the scene, he closes the door while lecturing Gir. On his way down to the lab
          Dib snaps his photo, he activates the security system. Two claws come out, just like before to try and electrocute Dib. Dib dodges them, but before
          he reaches the ground, a big net scoops him up. Your past self looks at the net confused, as you manically laugh behind the chair. He looks behind 
          the chair and is surprised to find you. "You're me?" As you look up at him, you quickly activate the watch. A portal opens.</h3>
