      <h3>Just for fun you explore Dib's body. You take pictures of yourself claiming parts of him. "Just wait until Dib sees these! The look on his face will be priceless." You check the time. "Dib is probably home now! I had better get to his arm control nerve and enact my plan!" Once in position, you hack into Dib's security system and locate him. Dib is on his way to the Livingroom. He sits down next to Gaz with an envelop in his hand.</h3>
