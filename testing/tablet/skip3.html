      <h3>You decided on building a time machine. Now complete, you program it to take you back to yesterday during school. That way you won't run into your past self.
          A portal opens in front of you, you step inside. In the blink of an eye you're back in the lab. You ask your computer what day it is. It
          replies. "Thursday April 13th." You excitedly shout. "I'm ingenious!" Now to fix that defective security system. You head down to the equipment
          room to gather supplies before heading up to the house. Gir is in the other room, having fun with his piggy. You set to work on improving
          the base's security system. Before long the upgrades are finished and appear fully functional. You find yourself bored, with several earth hours left until Dib arrives. Then it dawns on you, you could use the time machine to move forward in time to when Dib arrives! You use the time machine to move forward in time to when Dib arrives. You activate your pocket watch once again and advance several hours into the future. A portal opens up just like before, you step through it. In a blink of an eye you're back in the base! Is Gir back yet?</h3>
