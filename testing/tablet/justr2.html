      <h3>You arrive at Dib's arm control nerve and get into position. After hacking into his security cameras, you impatiently wait until he gets home. When Dib finally arrives, you watch him take a disc out of his room. Then he heads to the kitchen and retrieves an envelop. He quickly addresses it and put the disk inside. Finally, he walks to the Livingroom with it and takes a seat next to his sister.</h3>
