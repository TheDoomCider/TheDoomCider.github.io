      <h3>Using Dib's arm, you make her leave. In the process the disk falls in Dib's lap, you make him pick it up before broadcasting yourself on his TV. "Hello Dib." He foolishly thinks you're in the TV. You set him straight before using his hand to crush the disk. You're about to declare your victory when Dib informs you he has a master disc hidden somewhere.</h3>
