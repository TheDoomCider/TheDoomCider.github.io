      <h3>Gir takes notice of the portal. "Swirly thingy! Yay!" He jumps in after you, leaving your past self confused, with Dib still         trapped. In a blink of an eye, you're back to your own time but now there are two Girs! Present Gir gets up from the couch and       stands next to past Gir. Past Gir takes off his dog suit. The Girs speak in unison. "It me, but I me? Want to play tag?" Past Gir     is it, he chases present Gir around the house. You just stand there watching the chaos unfold. You take notice of Dib, still in       the net. "What's going on Zim?"</h3>
