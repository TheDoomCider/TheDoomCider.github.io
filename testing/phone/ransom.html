      <h3>By tapping into Dib's brainwaves, you eavesdrop on his thoughts. Equipped with a special megaphone, you await the right moment to impersonate Dib's conscience.</h3>
      
      <h3>*All I can think about is exposing Zim! At least this is my final class. I'm so bored. When is this class going to end?* *You shouldn't expose Zim. Destroy the pictures! Proving his alienism will result in eh... something bad.* "Alienism?" "Dib! What have I told you about talking to yourself?" "Not to?" *Keep it together Dib! The last thing you want to do is detention. Now, just a few more minutes until I can expose that alien!* "Destroy the images Dib!" *Is someone whispering in my ear? Nope, everyone seems too horrified by the lessons to mess with me.* "Destroy them now! Don't expose Zim." *Ok, this is weird. It sounds kind of like... ZIM! But how did he get inside my head? GET OUT OF MY HEAD ZIM!*</h3>
