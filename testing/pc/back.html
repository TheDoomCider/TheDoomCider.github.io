      <h3>Gir sees you step out the portal. "Wow, can I try!" "No! Just pretend I'm not here." You hide behind the chair. "Why are you hiding?" "Uh... I'm playing a game! It's called don't acknowledge me while I hide behind this chair." Your past self comes up from the lab to scold Gir about leaving the door open, his presence confuses Gir. "Master, why are there two of you?" Your past self ignores Gir's comment. On his way down to the lab, Dib snaps his photo! He activates the security system. Two claws come out, just like before to try and electrocute Dib. Dib dodges them, but before he reaches the ground, a big net scoops him up. Your past self looks at the net confused, as you manically laugh behind the chair. He looks behind the chair and is surprised to find you. "You're me?" As you look up at him, you quickly activate the watch. A portal opens.</h3>
