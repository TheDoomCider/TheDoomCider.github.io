      <h3>"I am you're conscience Dib, not you're amazing enemy!" *Give it up Zim, I know it's you! Also, why would my conscience 
	      sound like my enemy? I bet you don't even know what a conscience is.* "You know I can destroy your brain at the touch of
		  a button right? So, if you want to keep it intact, you had better stop trying my patience!" *Fine.* "Good, now I need 
		  you to destroy those pictures!" *So how did you get inside me anyway?* "Well I built this sub see. Then I teleported it
		  into your lunch and here I am. Impressed?" *You did all that just to destroy my pictures?* "What are you getting at?"
		  When Dib gets home, you hack into one of his hover cameras and watch as he retrieves a disc. "Now destroy it Dib!" 
		  Dib breaks it in half. *There, now leave my brain alone.* "Haha! It's been a pleasure defeating you!"</h3>
