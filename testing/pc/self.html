      <h3>Taking matters into your own hands, you head to Dib's arm control nerve. Using the security cameras, you locate Dib. He's in the kitchen now, about to put the disc in an envelop. Using Dib's arm you crush it! He angrily heads back to his room and takes out a second disc. You make him crush that too. Dib takes out a camera and plugs it into his computer. Some images appear on his screen. You catch sight of them. "Wow, these are the worst pictures I've ever seen! I'm relieved, yet insulted because he made me look like a green blob!" You delete the insulting depictions and broadcast yourself to Dib's computer screen. "Zim? What are you doing in my computer?" "I'm not in your computer, I'm transmitting from inside your body! I succeeded in destroying your horrific pictures. now you have nothing! On a side note, how could you make someone amazing as me look like a pathetic blob? For shame Dib! For shame!" You end the broadcast and escape out Dib's nose.</h3>
