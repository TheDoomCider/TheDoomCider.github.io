      <h3>"You took pictures of me, so I built a time machine to stop you." "I didn't take any pictures of you Zim." "Well in a reality that no longer exists, you did." "Ok..." You notice one of the Girs' heading right for you! You quickly open a portal in front of him. Gir tries to follow his twin and you're half tempted to let him, but you find yourself stopping him. What do you plan to with Dib?</h3>
