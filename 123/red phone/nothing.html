      <h3>You pretend pull something out from behind you and introduce it to Zim. &#34;This is our topic secret model, Lir.&#34; Zim gives you a hard look. &#34;I don't 
          see anything...&#34; Purple chimes in. &#34;Yes well, that's what the enemy will think. Get it?&#34; Zim is fascinated. &#34;How does it work?&#34; You answer. &#34;Very well thanks for asking.&#34; "Eh?" You inform Zim that there are other invaders behind you. He moves, calling Lir before heading off.  You are happy 
          to say that, that is the last time you've ever seen or heard from Zim.</h3>
