      <h3>You tell Zim, you have a top-secret model for him. You call for one your servants to bring in Kir. A frightened Irken appears with a sir. He gives 
          it to Zim before fleeing. Zim is curious. &#34;What's his problem?&#34; You improvise. &#34;He doesn't want to miss out on the donuts. That reminds me, lets go
          get some." Everyone leaves except Zim and Kir. You use the security system to spy on them and much to your amusement Kir activates! &#34;Kir reporting
          for duty.&#34; Zim is confused. &#34;What does the K stand for?&#34; Kir grimly answers. &#34;Killer.&#34; Not liking the sound of that, Zim goes on the defense. He
          activates his pak legs preparing for battle. Kir just sits there. Now Zim is confused. &#34;I thought you said you were a killer?&#34; Kir responds.
          &#34;Oh I am but not in the context you're thinking. I'm a killer information retrieval unit, meaning i'm really good at gathering intelligence.&#34; Zim
          relaxes, your jaw drops. You turn to Purple. &#34;Wait, what?&#34; He confers. &#34;I know right, it's so hard to get a good assassin these days.&#34; You explain.
          &#34;No, it's not that, I mean we wasted a perfectly good robot on Zim! Why didn't we just give him one out of the trash?&#34; Zim and Kir head for Blorch to begin their mission. Just when you think Zim is out of your life for good, he calls
          you the following day to inform you he has already conquered Blorch. You are in disbelief.</h3>
