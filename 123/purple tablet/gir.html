      <h3>You tell Zim you have a top-secret model for him. Red quickly builds one out of garbage. Zim doesn't think it looks good. You explain. &#34;Yes, well
          that's what the enemy will think! Get it?&#34; He thinks it's genius. You and Red snicker as Gir activates. &#34;Gir, reporting for duty.&#34; Zim 
          is curious about what the G stands for. Gir doesn't know and begins banging his head while carrying on. Zim is concerned. You reassure
          him before moving him along. You are happy to say that, that is the last time you've ever seen or heard from him!</h3>
