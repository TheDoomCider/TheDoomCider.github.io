      <h3>You tell Zim, you have a top-secret model for him. You call for one of your servants to bring in Kir. A frightened Irken appears with a sir. He gives
          it to Zim before fleeing. Zim is curious. &#34;What's his problem?&#34; You improvise. &#34;He doesn't want to miss out on the free donuts. That reminds me, lets
          go get some!&#34; Everyone leaves except Zim and Kir. You use the security system to spy on them, much to your amusement Kir activates! &#34;Kir reporting for
          duty.&#34; Zim is confused. &#34;What does the K stand for?&#34; Kir grimly answers. &#34;Killer.&#34; Not liking the sound of that, Zim goes on the defensive. He
          activates his pak legs preparing for battle. Kir just sits there. Now Zim is really confused. &#34;I thought you said you were a killer?&#34; Kir responds.
          &#34;Oh I am but not in the context your thinking. I'm a killer information retrieval unit, meaning i'm really good at gathering intelligence.&#34; Zim
          relaxes. Your and Red's jaws drop. Red turns to you. &#34;Wait, what?&#34; You confer. &#34;I know right, it's so hard to get a good assassin these days.&#34;
          Red explains. &#34;No, it's not that, I mean we wasted a perfectly good robot on Zim! Why didn't we just give him one out of the trash?&#34; Zim and Kir
          head for Blorch to begin their mission. Just when you think Zim is out of your life for good, he calls you the following day to inform you he has
          already conqueRed Blorch! You are in disbelief.</h3>
