      <h3>Not wanting to deal with Zim, you call for the guards to arrest him! He is scared and confused.
          &#34;What are you doing my tallest?&#34; You are annoyed by his question. &#34;Taking you back to
          Foodcourtia.&#34; He counters. &#34;I quit remember?&#34; Sizzlorr barges into the convention hall. &#34;I beg to differ!&#34; Zim gulps before being returned to Foodcourtia. A week later, on the massive,
          you receive an incoming call. Zim appears on the screen. &#34;I passed your test my tallest!&#34; You and
          Red are confused. What test? He continues. &#34;Don't be so modest. You shipped me back to Foodcourtia
          with heightened security; to see if I would be prepared to escape an enemy prison. In the event,
          I got captured during my mission. &#34;So, what is it?&#34; You are still not following. &#34;What?&#34;
          Zim laughs. &#34;My mission, silly.&#34; &#34;Oh right, that. Since you did such a great job
          on Foodcourtia, you get to... Test the empire's prisons. Since you're
          such a great escape artist.&#34; Red likes where you are going with this. &#34;Yeah, we will send some
          guards to take you to Vort and get you started.&#34;</h3>
