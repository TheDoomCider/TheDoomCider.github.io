      <h3>You pretend to pull something out from behind you and introduce it to Zim. &#34;This is our topic secret model, Lir.&#34; He gives you a hard look.
          &#34;I don't see anything...&#34; Red chimes in. &#34;Yes well, that's what the enemy will think. Get it?&#34; Zim is intrigued. &#34;How does it work?&#34; Red answers.
          &#34;Very well thanks for asking.&#34; Zim is confused by his remark. You inform him that there are other invaders behind him. He moves, calling Lir
          before heading off. Six months later you receive a call from Earth. Zim appears on the screen catching you and Red completely off guard. He complains.
          &#34;Lir isn't very obedient! In fact, he is down right lazy.&#34; You snicker at the fact Zim still hasn't figured out Lir isn't real. Red pretends
          to troubleshoot. &#34;Maybe youâ€™re not ordering him order right. Have you tried singing to him?&#34; You and Red break down laughing. Zim isn't
          following. &#34;Singing? What do you mean my tallest?&#34; You try to keep a straight face. &#34;He responds best when you sing him his commands.&#34;
          Zim starts to get it. &#34;Ok? Thank you my tallest, Invader Zim signing off.&#34; He hangs up.</h3>
