      <h3>You pretend to pull something out from behind you and introduce it to Zim. &#34;This is our topic secret model, Lir.&#34; He gives you a hard look.
          &#34;I don't see anything...&#34; You explain. &#34;Yes well, that's what the enemy will think. Get it?" Zim is intrigued. &#34;How does it work?&#34; Red answers.
          &#34;Very well thanks for asking.&#34; Zim is confused by his remark. You inform him that there are other invaders behind him. He moves, calling Lir before heading off.
          You are happy to say that, that is the last time you've ever seen or heard from him!</h3>
