      <h3>You inform Zim that you have a topic secret model for him. Red quickly assembles a sir using scrap parts. You throw it on the floor near Zim. He
          doesn't like the look of it. It activates. &#34;Gir reporting for duty.&#34; Confused, Zim asks. &#34;What does the G stand for?&#34; Gir tells him
          he doesn't know before banging his head and carrying on. Zim comments on his behaviour. &#34;Is it supposed to be stupid?&#34; You answer. 
          &#34;It's not stupid, it's advanced!&#34; Zim buys it and leaves to start his mission. Six months later he calls you from Earth. You are caught
          off guard, thinking heâ€™s been dead all this time.</h3>
