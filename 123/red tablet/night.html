      <h3>You appear on a slowly, lowering platform, before the crowd gathered on Conventia, gloating to Purple, about your laser idea being a hit. Purple isn't
          buying it and clings to his smoke machine suggestion. He gets a laser in the eye. The platform reaches the ground and you begin addressing the crowd.
          &#34;Welcome mighty Irken soldiers! You are the finest examples of military training the Irken army has to offer! Good for you.&#34; You introduce the invaders chosen to gather intel
          for Operation Impending Doom 2. Before the great assigning, you and Purple brief the invaders, on their mission. Just as things are wrapping
          up you hear a familiar voice. You recognize it belongs to none other than Zim! He apologizes for his tardiness.</h3>
