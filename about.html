      <h3 id="idea">Where did the idea come from?</h3>
   
      <p>Just after I was introduced Invader Zim, I started discovering some of the different fan projects linked to it. I liked that fans were making amazing contributions to the show. I wanted to contribute to the fandom as well with my own project but didn’t have any ideas at the time.</p>
    
      <p>Months later, I was Python as part of my Information Technology course. The instructor was lecturing about if statements, he compared them to a choose your own adventure game. Now long after, I started on Python based proto-type called invader_zim _sim. It featured a mock character list, and an incomplete version of Megadoomer. Unfortunately, it took forever to program and compatibility was a major issue.</p>
    
      <img class="py" src="sim.jpg" alt="proto-type" width="90%"/>
    
      <h3 id="name">Where did the name come from?</h3>
    
      <p>While creating a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=stE4xnPMODE" target="new">trailer for the proto-type</a> I knew I needed a better name than invader_zim_sim. So, I renamed it The DoomCider, a play on doom and decider. After publishing the trailer, I was surprised that people were excited to play it!</p>
    
      <h3 id="html">Why switch from Python to HTML?</h3>
    
      <p>I hated web development at the time. I only switched over for compatability reasons. Fortunately, the transition dramatically simplified, sped up development and made me love web. Inspite of this Megadoomer was still taking forever to complete and I began growing impatient with my miniscule progress. After about a month of development, I finally got to an ending. In ended creating two others and turn the incomplete page maze into a demo.</p>
    
      <img class="py" src="demo.jpg" alt="demo" />
    
      <h3 id="narration">What inspired you to include character narrators?</h3>
    
      <p id="bottom">Prior to releasing the demo, I recalled a video I had watched about a month prior to starting this project. It was published by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnUf-X860T_pmUWY-kyTCuw" target="new">Shining Cecil</a> and involved him reading the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz_YOAs0OYM" target="new">Pokemon hand book in Zim’s voice</a>. It stuck in my memory and sparked the idea of character narrators.</p>
    
      <h3 id="icons">Why are the characters silhouettes?</h3>
    
      <p>When I first started developing the HTML version of the game, I googled stock images. I had to of course change them before I released the demo. At the time I had very limited art skills, so I created some basic silhouettes in paint. Shortly after I changed the icons, <a>Peter Fields</a> offered to improve them. His designs are what is featured in the current selection menu, although I did do the Keef's icon/animation.</p>
