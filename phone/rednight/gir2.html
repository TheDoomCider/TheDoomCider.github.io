      <h3>You inform Zim that you have a top-secret model for him and quickly assemble a sir using scrap parts. Purple throws it near Zim. He doesn't like the
          look of it. It activates. &#34;Gir reporting for duty.&#34; Confused, Zim asks. "What does the G stand for?&#34; Gir tells him he doesn't know before banging his
          head and carrying on. Zim comments on his behaviour. &#34;Is it supposed to be stupid?&#34; Purple answers him. &#34;It's not stupid, it's advanced!&#34; Zim buys it
          and leaves to start his mission. Six months later he calls you from Earth. You are surprised, thinking heâ€™s been dead all this time.</h3>
