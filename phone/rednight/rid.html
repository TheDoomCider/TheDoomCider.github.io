      <h3>You point out he wasn't invited and Purple reminds him he is supposed to be banished. He obviously doesn't understand the concept. Zim reminds you
          of his work in Operation Impending Doom 1. Purple tries to use Zim's size against him in a failed attempt to make him leave. You try to buy him off
          with a sandwich but Zim won't leave until he gets a chance to prove himself.</h3>
