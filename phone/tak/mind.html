      <h3>Using your mind control powers, you order them to stop. They obey. Pleased, you finish reciting your poem and throw, the ribs stashed in your pak, at Zim. He screams in agony. At the end the day you return to your secret lair and call the tallest. As you inform them of your plan, you learn some juicy gossip about Zim! Before you sign off, they agree to make you an invader if you succeed. The next day at skool Zim's convinced you're in love with him. Hahaha!</h3>
