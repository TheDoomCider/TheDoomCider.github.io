      <h3>You start with Gaz looking over you, supposedly making sure your answers are right. She shakes her head each time you think your doing great. You
          look around but each time, Gaz stops you, making sure you don&#39t cheat. This continues 
          until, you see the person behind Gaz. She holds her hand up and the robot comes over.... SHE IS REJECTED. The bot comes your way and takes your test,
          your accepted, the bot plays a victory tune. Another tube lowers, once again your sucked in. You end up in a battle arena and you notice you are now wearing a battle suit. A whole array
          of weapons come out of the wall including a giant dropper, two types of tweezers and a corkscrew.</h3>
