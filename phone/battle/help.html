      <h3>You flashback to the pizza argument. Gaz says she here to help you out. You thank her. When you&#39re not looking, Gaz swirls her finger
          around her head as a mocking of you being crazy. The guard shocks you once again. "Professor membrane is shooting his show. The only way you 
          get to see him is if you make into the audience." You counter. "He&#39s my dad!" The guard shocks you yet again. "OTHER SIDE OF THE BUILDING!"
          Zapped again, you groan as a large tube appears over your head, sucking you inside. You land in a empty desk, your case falls on your head.
          A robot with a piece of paper and a pencil hovers over you. Its an exam!</h3>
