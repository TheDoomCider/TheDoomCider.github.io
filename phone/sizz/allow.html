      <h3>You approve his request and Gashloog takes over the counter. Bob is the first to order, Zim quickly fills it before disappearing. You search 
          the restaurant for him, but turn up nothing. You look outside, thinking he somehow escaped. At that moment Zim jumps out of Bob's stomach,
          making a break for it. You armour up to pursue him, angrily making your way through the crowd. You almost get him but he dodges you, boarding
          a cab at the last minute. Not letting that stop you, you jump on the surrounding ships to catch him! When your near enough, you jam your
          giant spatula into his ship, later using it pry open the roof. Grabbing Zim, you try to force him out the hole you made. The ship heads for a
          donut sign!</h3>
