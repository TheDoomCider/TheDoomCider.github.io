      <h3>You tell Zim, you have a top secret model for him. You call for one of your servants to bring in Kir. A frightened irken appears with a sir. He gives it to Zim before fleeing. Zim is curious. "What's his problem?" You improvise. "He doesn't want to miss out on the free donuts.
          That reminds me, lets go get some!" Everyone leaves except Zim and Kir. You and Red use the security system to spy on them, much to your
           amusement Kir activates! "Kir reporting for duty." Zim is confused. "What does the K stand for?" Kir grimly answers. "Killer." Not liking the 
          sound of that, Zim goes on the defensive. He activates his pak legs preparing for battle. Kir just sits there. Now Zim is really confused. "I
          thought you said you were a killer?" Kir responds. "Oh I am but not in the context you're thinking. I'm a killer information retrieval unit, meaning
          i'm really good at gathering intelligence." Zim relaxes. Your and Red's jaws drop. Red turns to you. "Wait, what?" You confer.
          "I know right, it's so hard to get a good assassin these days." Red explains. "No it's not that, I mean we wasted a perfectly good robot on Zim! Why 
          didn't we give him one out of the trash?" Zim and Kir head for the mystery planet to begin their mission. Just when you think Zim is out 
          of your life for good, he calls you six months later to update you on his mission. You are in disbelief, thinking he was dead all this time.</h3>
