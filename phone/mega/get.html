      <h3>You slip on your human disguise, and head to the bakery. The place is a disaster, icing, cake and fire all around.
          It isn&#39t long before you spot Gir. He is full of cake and sitting in a giant pile of cupcake wrappers! Trying to 
          convey the urgency of the situation, you frantically try to convince Gir to leave with you. Gir, we need to get out 
          of here! You and those horrible robots are drawing attention! Not to mention the Voot is parked next door! Gir thinks 
          about this for a moment before protesting, I like it here, it is cupcake heaven! You try to bargain; we have lots of 
          cupcakes in the holo interface room! They talk and uh, stuff. Gir excitedly tries to get up to go with you. He is 
          too heavy to move! You quickly blast a hole in the ceiling and get back to the ship. Using the tractor beam, you grab 
          Gir and head home.</h3>
