      <h3>The army fires the first shot, since you aren't cloaked it's a direct hit! Not wanting to receive another one of those, you quickly activate the 
          cloak. The damage you took seems to have fried it and several missiles are coming your way! You use the Megadoomer's force field to defend yourself.
          Although, with the army hammering you, it won't hold up very long. Thankfully there is a slight lull. Using this to your advantage, you lower your
          defenses and hit them with everything you've got!</h3>
