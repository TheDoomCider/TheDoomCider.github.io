      <h3>There isn't a moment to waste. You look over at Gir, he is busy playing in the water. You try to get his attention.
          "Quickly Gir, use your jets to push the cruiser to land!" He looks over at you confused. "Did you say something?" 
          The rising water is getting to you. "Hurry Gir! The cruiser is almost submerged!" Gir is still confused. "What you 
          want me to do?" You growl. "FLY THE SHIP TO SHORE! Now Gir!" Gir does as he is told and before you know it you are...
          well in the middle of nowhere.
