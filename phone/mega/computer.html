      <h3>Amused, Gir presses it again and again. When you go to stop him.... something unexpected happens. The cruiser shakes violently, knocking you and Gir
          away from the controls. You ask your computer what's going on. The only response you get is multiple voices talking at once! Gir recognizes they
          belong to his 'friends'. Alarmed by this grim realization, you try to make you way to the controls. It isn't an easy task, but despite the nauseating
          shaking, you persevere. Now at the console, you try to get the ship back under control. Unfortunately, manual control has been disabled. As you
          struggle to override, Gir tries to talk some sense into his pals. "Friends, you scaring my master!" The sirs listen and stop messing with the ship.
          Just when you think things have settled.</h3>
