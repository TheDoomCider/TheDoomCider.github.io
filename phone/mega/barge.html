      <h3>While sneaking into your base, Dib takes notice of your current situation. He makes his presence known. "If anyone is going to destroy Zim, it's
          going to be me!" Gir's attention is redirected toward Dib. While they are distracted, you make a break for your lab. Halfway there, Gir and Dib take
          notice of your absence and quickly chase after you. You activate the elevator before they reach you. Now in your lab, you franticly search for an
          electromagnet. Your enemies arrive as you locate it. Turning it on, you throw it directly at Gir. He short circuits as does Dib's camera.</h3>
