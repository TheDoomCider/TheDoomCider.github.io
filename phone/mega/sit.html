      <h3>You continue to watch the chaos unfold, cheering the sirs on! It isn't long until they bring the city and soon the world to it's knees! The 
          military and the Dib were no match for their insanity and thirst for destruction! You're in disbelief when president man and the other world
          leaders come together. They give the robots rule over Earth! Disbelief quickly turns to outrage! "Hey, those robots are taking credit for my win!
          Zim rules this world not them!" You fly to the ceremony in your Voot with Gir. Now face to face with your new enemies, you get ready to battle for
          dominion over Earth. Just before you engage them, they turn to Gir, giving the power to him. He's overjoyed. You demand that Gir give it to you.
          He refuses, your efforts to make him reconsider land you in jail. You sigh, accepting your fate until you realize your cellmate is none other than
          Dib!</h3>
