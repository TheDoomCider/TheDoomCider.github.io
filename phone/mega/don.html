      <h3>You go to examine the robots but your touch triggers their destructive insanity! However, instead of attacking you. They target your neighbourhood!
          You soon realize those loonies could be useful. Gir switches on the TV, displaying a newscaster. &#34;As you can see tiny insane robots have
          started destroying the city! Fortunately, they only seem to be targeting condemned buildings, leaving demolition crews conflicted.&#34; She holds a
          microphone out to one of the workers, jabbing him in the eye. "Ow!" He takes it from her. &#34;I don't know whether to thank them for doing our work for us or
          to be as mad blazes. I mean it's like destroying, but I'm also lazy. May I just say that this is the first time I been on tel-&#34; She snatches it back from him.
          &#34;May I just say that is the last time you'll ever be on television!&#34; The station shows some footage of sirs. &#34;Look at those little robots go!&#34; Gir
          is confused by your reaction. &#34;But if they conquer the world, won't they steal your cupcakes?&#34;</h3>
