      <h3>Dib declares his victory and runs back into the house. You try to follow but he turned on his security system. Inside, Dib calls Crop Circles Magazine
          on one of his Dad's hover cams. "Hi, I have pictures of an alien robot!" He shows them the pictures he downloaded to his computer. They laugh, much to
          Dib's confusion. "Wow kid, that is an amazing editing job!" Dib is enraged. "Hey, those photos are real! See, here is one of me standing next to it."
          The editor rolls his eyes and hangs up. Hearing the whole thing, you laugh at Dib's pathetic attempt to expose you.</h3>
