      <h3>While hovering over the lake, You reach into your pak and pull out what looks like a GPS. Seeing the device, Gir immediately asks what it is.
          While configuring the device, you explain that it is a MAP: Mechanical Area Pin pointer. You humans know it by the name GPS. Finished, you point
          Gir in the direction of your base. The MAP makes for a hassle-free journey home. Now you have a bone to pick with the Tallest. You call and ask
          them about the sir units. At first they play dumb, but Purple eventually explains. "Oh, those sirs. Since you have been doing a good job on
          Earth we decided to send an army to help you out." Red interrupts. "They must have gotten damaged during transport." Satisfied with their explanation
          you hang up.</h3>
