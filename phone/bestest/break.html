      <h3>You're running out of ideas, so you take a break. As you fixate on your bestie's house, you realize that there
          is one thing you haven't tried. You walk back up to Zim's porch and ring his doorbell. The door opens revealing the green dog. "You no leprechaun."
          You interrupt him. "Who are you and where is Zim?" He points at a toilet. "I'm Gir! My master is busy in the toilet!" You are somewhat disappointed. "Oh... when will he be back?" Gir shrugs. "I don't know. Wanna do stuff?"</h3>
