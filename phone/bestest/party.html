      <h3>You inform Gir, that you plan to throw a party to cheer Zim up. At skool, you hand out invitations to everyone in the cafeteria. Only a few
          kids seem interested. You take them over to Zim's house after class, they wait outside while you get Zim. When you enter the house, Zimmy hands you
          a present. Next thing you know he's outside. You follow him up a building onto a narrow ledge. He tackles you, causing you to fall. You hit the ground,
          your body broken. Like a phoenix, you burst into flames. Two days later you are reborn from your ashes, and resume life as though you had never met
          Zim. You study him, trying to figure out what you did wrong.</h3>
