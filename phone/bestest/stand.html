      <h3>You stand up, angered by Jessica. "Hey, thatâ€™s no way to talk to my best friend! Come on, lets get out of here." She is left speechless.
          Zim takes you somewhere private to discuss the terms of your friendship. Later you and Zim play tether ball. He uses you like a paddle. You win and celebrate by doing the best friend dance you've
          been practicing. In art class, you and Zim draw pictures of the two of you together. Later you walk the hall with Zim. You accidentally bump into
          him, he pushes you down.</h3>
